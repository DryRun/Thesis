\section{Run I Luminosity}

The ATLAS Run I data were recorded from 2011 to 2012, with a center-of-mass collision energy of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{7}{\tera\electronvolt}$ in 2011 and $\sqrt{s}=\SI{8}{\tera\electronvolt}$ during 2012. Integrated luminosities of $L=\int \mathcal{L}\, dt=\SI{5.46}{\femto\barn\tothe{-1}}$, and $\SI{22.8}{\femto\barn\tothe{-1}}$ were delivered by the LHC in the two years, of which $\SI{5.08}{\femto\barn\tothe{-1}}$ and $\SI{21.3}{\femto\barn\tothe{-1}}$ were recorded by the ATLAS detector. The recorded luminosity accounts for the data acquisition inefficiency, as well as the \emph{warm start} period, an interval of several minutes after the LHC has of stable beams during which the tracking detectors are ramped to high voltage and the pixel detector preamplifiers are turned on. After masking data recorded while one or more detector subsystems were not functioning properly, $\SI{4.57}{\femto\barn\tothe{-1}}$ and $\SI{20.3}{\femto\barn\tothe{-1}}$ of data are considered ready for physics analyses. The volume of delivered, recorded, and physics-ready data are shown as a function of time in figure~\ref{fig:reco-luminosity-runI}. 

During Run I, the LHC was typically operated with 1368 bunches with a bunch spacing of $\SI{50}{\nano\second}$. The peak instantaneous luminosity reached values as high as $\mathcal{L}\sim\SI[per-mode=symbol]{8e33}{\centi\meter\tothe{-2}\second\tothe{-1}}$, corresponding to a peak average pileup value of $\mu\sim37$. The distribution of pileup values in 2011 and 2012 data are shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-luminosity-pileup}.

\section{Measurement Overview}\label{sec:luminosity-overview}
The instantaneous luminosity at a $pp$ collider is given by:

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{R_{\mathrm{inel}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}}},
\end{equation}

where $R_{\mathrm{inel}}$ is the rate of inelastic $pp$ collisions, and $\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}}$ is the $pp$ inelastic cross section. For a storage ring with a revolution frequency $f_r$ and $n_b$ colliding bunch pairs, the instantaneous luminosity can be written in terms of the average number of inelastic $pp$ collisions per bunch cross, $\mu$, as 

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{\mu f_r n_b}{\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}}}.
\end{equation}

The instantaneous luminosity is measured by ATLAS using several detectors and algorithms, which have some efficiency $\epsilon$ to detect a $pp$ interaction and measure the \emph{visible} number of interactions per bunch crossing, $\mu_{\mathrm{vis}} = \epsilon \mu$. Defining the visible cross section to be $\sigma_{\mathrm{vis}}\equiv \epsilon \sigma_{\mathrm{vis}}$, the instantaneous luminosity as measured by a particular detector is:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:reco-luminosity-detected}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{\mu_{\mathrm{vis}} f_r n_b}{\sigma_{\mathrm{vis}}}.
\end{equation}

The visible cross section is a calibration constant for a particular detector, which is determined during dedicated calibration runs in which the luminosity is determined directly from the geometry of the beams. The calibration procedure is described in section~\ref{sec:reco-luminosity-calibration}. 

\section{Luminosity Detectors}\label{sec:reco-luminosity-detectors}
ATLAS performs many redundant luminosity measurements using several detectors. The detectors fall into two categories. \emph{Event counting} detectors have a binary response, returning a 0 or 1 depending on whether a bunch crossing satisfies a set of criteria defined to detect an inelastic $pp$ collision. Such detectors essentially measure $p(0;\,\mu)$, the probability that an event falls in the zero bin of a Poisson distribution, from which the mean $\mu$ be calculated. \emph{Hit counting} detectors, on the other hand, count some quantity proportional to the number of interactions in a given bunch crossing, such as the number of particles identified by a particular detector subsystem. A hit counting measurement typically yields more information about an event at the cost of additional systematic uncertainties.

Ideally, a luminosity detector exhibits the following features: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item The efficiency of the detector should be insensitive to pileup. The visible cross sections are typically measured at $\mu\approx \mathcal{O}(1)$, while a typical data-taking run has $10\lesssim\mu\lesssim50$; it is essential that the visible cross section be constant across this range of pileup values.

	\item The efficiency of the detector should also be constant over long timescales.

	\item The response of the detector and the readout should fast enough to provide a bunch-by-bunch luminosity measurement. As the LHC bunches are not identical, with different numbers of protons and emittances, it is useful to measure luminosity for each colliding bunch pair, as often as once every $\SI{25}{\nano\second}$. The colliding bunch pairs are labeled by the bunch crossing identification number, or BCID; consecutive BCIDs are separated by $\SI{25}{\nano\second}$. 

	\item The efficiency should be high enough to yield sufficient statistics. The data are used in increments as shorts as $\SI{20}{\second}$, so the statistics collected over this time scale scale should be high enough that the total uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects. On the other hand, for event counting detectors, the efficiency should not be so high that the detector is saturated; the uncertainty on $\mu$ is large if $p(0;\mu)$ is too close to 0 or 1. 

	\item The backgrounds should be low and understandable. Detectors can be sensitive to a wide range of phenomena aside from $pp$ collisions, which should not be counted as luminosity. For example, some detectors observe a phenomenon called \emph{afterglow}, a small amount of activity in the BCIDs immediately following a collision likely due to photons from nuclear deexcitations in the detector material. The afterglow background is proportional to the luminosity in the colliding BCIDs, and decays away with several time constants. Collisions between a beam and residual gas in the beam pipe, called \emph{beam-gas interactions}, can also contribute a low level of background, and is estimated by observing non-colliding bunches passing through the interaction region.

\end{itemize}

The central value of the luminosity measurement is determined by the \emph{beam conditions monitor} (BCM), which fulfills most of these desired criteria. The BCM consists of eight diamond-based particle detectors, four on each side of the interaction point at $|z|=\SI{184}{\centi\meter}$ and $|\eta|=4.2$. The detectors are have a physical cross section of approximately $\SI{1}{\centi\meter\tothe{2}}$ and are arranged in a cross pattern, with two readouts corresponding to the vertical and horizontal pairs. The design purpose of the BCM is to monitor backgrounds and to trigger a beam dump if beam losses towards the inner detector become too high; accordingly, the detector has a very fast readout, and can provide a bunch-by-bunch luminosity measurement with a time resolution of $\sim \SI{0.7}{\nano\second}$. The luminosity is measured using event counting, and can be measured using any combination of the readouts. The configurations used require hits in either the vertical pair (BCMV) or the horizontal pair (BCMH), and either coincident hits on both sides of the interaction point (AND) or a single hit on either side (OR). The small size of the readouts leads to an efficiency of approximately 7\% in the OR configuration, which allows for sufficient statistics without saturating the detector. 

The LUCID detector provides a supplementary, bunch-by-bunch, event counting-based luminosity measurement. The detector consists of two sets of sixteen Cherenkov detectors surrounding the beampipe at $z=\pm\SI{17}{\meter}$, occupying the pseudorapidity range $5.6<|\eta|<6.0$. The Cherenkov detectors are polished aluminum tubes filled with C$_4$F$_{10}$ gas. The Cherekov photons induced by charged particles traversing the gas are collected by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) located at the far end of the tubes. Additional Cherenkov photons are produced in the quartz window separating the tube volume from the PMT. In this configuration, the typical single-particle yield is 60-70 photoelectrons due to photons created in the gas, and about 40 photoelectrons due to the quartz window. A hit is recorded if the PMT signal exceeds a preset threshold, corresponding to about 15 photoelectrons. However, the higher instantaneous luminosities due to the $\SI{50}{\nano\second}$ bunch spacing led to saturation of the detectors, and hence on 30 July 2011, the gas was removed from the Cherenkov tubes to reduce the efficiency. The removal of the gas also improved the detector's stability and linearity with respect to pileup. Relative comparisons with other detectors were used to reestablish the detector calibration.

Several detector subsystems nominally designed for physics object reconstruction are also used for hit counting-based luminosity measurements. Algorithms using the tile calorimeter and the forward calorimeters (see section~\ref{sec:ATLAS-calorimeters}) determine the luminosity from detector currents proportional to the total particle flux in small regions of the calorimeters. The tile calorimeter algorithm monitors the PMT currents corresponding to a few selected cells near $|\eta|=1.25$, where the highest sensitivity to changes in the luminosity is observed. Similarly, the forward calorimeter algorithm monitors the currents in the high voltage lines. In both cases, the detector response is too slow to provide a bunch-by-bunch measurement, and the current response is not sensitive to the low instantaneous luminosities during the dedicated calibration runs, requiring the calibration to be set using a relative comparison with LUCID. On the other hand, the detectors exhibit good linearity of response with pileup, and good short-term stability. 

Finally, algorithms using the inner detector measure the luminosity by counting reconstructed tracks and vertices\footnote{Pixel cluster counting, used by the CMS experiment, was also considered, but was not commissioned due to the difficulty of the background subtraction.}. The use of these higher-level objects confers certain benefits, such as low background rates and good long-term stability, at the cost of increased computational requirements, which limit the data rate to $\mathcal{O}(\SI{100}{\hertz})$. Further, pileup effects can be significant; in particular, the efficiency of the vertex counting algorithm varies by as much as $30\%$ up to pileup values of $\mu=30$, limiting its utility to data with low pileup. 

\section{Luminosity Calibration: van der Meer Scans}\label{sec:reco-luminosity-calibration}
The visible cross sections for the detectors and algorithms described in section~\ref{sec:reco-luminosity-detectors} are calibrated during dedicated runs called van der Meer (vdM) scans. The calibration procedure uses the definition of luminosity in terms of the beam parameters, given for a single colliding bunch by:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:luminosity-geometrical}
	\mathcal{L} = f_r n_1 n_2 K \int \rho_1(x,y,z,t) \rho_2(x,y,z,t) dx\,dy\,dz\,dt,
\end{equation}

where $f_r$ is the revolution frequency, $n_{1,2}$ are the number of particles in the colliding bunches, and $\rho_{1,2}(x,y,z,t)$ are the time- and position-dependent particle density distribution, normalized so that $\int \rho_{1,2}(x,y,z,t)dx\,dy\,dz = 1$. $K$ is a kinematic factor,

\begin{equation}
	K=\sqrt{(\vec{v}_1-\vec{v}_2)^2 - \frac{(\vec{v}_1\times\vec{v}_2)^2}{c^2}},
\end{equation}

which, in the limit $|\vec{v}_{1,2}|\rightarrow c$, reduces to $2c\cos\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the crossing angle between the beams. For simplicity, the crossing angle is assumed to be zero, and the bunch densities are assumed to be functions of $x$, $y$, and $z\pm ct$, i.e. that the transverse bunch profiles are constant over the duration of the collision
\footnote{Specifically, the \emph{hourglass effect} is neglected. The collisions occur in a drift space, where the beams are typically focused, or squeezed, onto the interaction point. The transverse size of the beam in direction $i$ as a function of $z$ is given by $\sigma_{i}^2(z)=\epsilon_{i} \beta^*_{i} \left(1+\frac{(z-z_{i}^w)^2}{{\beta^*_{i}}^2}\right)$, where $\epsilon_{i}$ is the transverse emittance, $z_i^w$ is location of the optical waist, and $\beta^*_i$ is the betatron function at $z=z_i^w$. The effect is significant when $\beta^*_i\lesssim \sigma_z$; during the vdM scans, $\sigma_z\approx \SI{50}{\milli\meter}$, while $\beta^*=\SI{1.5}{\meter}$-$\SI{11}{\meter}$, and hence the hourglass effect is neglected.}. The luminosity can then be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}=f_r n_1 n_2 \int \hat{\rho}_1(x,\,y)\hat{\rho}_2(x,\,y) dx\,dy,
\end{equation}

where $\hat{\rho}_{1,2}(x,\,y)$ are the transverse particle densities, normalized to unity. Under the further assumption that the transverse particle densities factorize in the horizontal and vertical directions, $\hat{\rho}(x,\,y)=\rho_x(x)\rho_y(y)$, the luminosity can be written as:

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = f_r n_1 n_2 \Omega_x(\rho_{x1},\,\rho_{x2}) \Omega_y(\rho_{y1},\,\rho_{y2}),
\end{equation}

where $\Omega_x(\rho_{x1},\,\rho_{x2})=\int \rho_{x1}(x) \rho_{x2}(x) dx$, and similarly for the $y$ direction. As first proposed by van der Meer~\cite{vdm}, the $\Omega_{x,y}$ parameters can be determined by measuring the interaction rate $R$ as a function of transverse beam displacement $\delta$,

\begin{equation}
	\Omega_x (\rho_{x1},\,\rho_{x2}) = \frac{R_x(0)}{\int R_x(\delta) d\delta}.
\end{equation}

For convenience, define $\Sigma_{x,y}$ to be the characteristic widths of $R_{x,y}(\delta$, given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:reco-luminosity-CapSigma}
	\Sigma_{x,y}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \frac{\int R_{x,y}(\delta)\,d\delta}{R_{x,y}(0)}.
\end{equation}

For Gaussian beams, $\Sigma_{x,y}$ correspond to the standard deviation of $R_{x,y}(\delta)$. Finally, the luminosity is given by

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{f_r n_1 n_2}{2\pi \Sigma_x \Sigma_y}.
\end{equation}

Equating this with the luminosity defined in equation~\ref{eqn:reco-luminosity-detected}, the visible cross section for a given detector and algorithm is given by

\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{\mathrm{vis}} = \mu_{\mathrm{vis}}^{\mathrm{MAX}} \frac{2\pi \Sigma_x \Sigma_y}{n_1 n_2},
\end{equation}

where $\mu_{\mathrm{vis}}^{\mathrm{MAX}}$ is the visible interaction rate per bunch crossing at the maximum of the scan curve, $R(\delta)$. The numbers of particles per bunch, $n_{1,2}$, are measured by the LHC Bunch Current Normalization Working Group using bunch current transformers (BCTs)~\cite{BCNWG}. 

As an example, the 2011 $pp$ calibration is derived from two pairs of scans in the $x$- and $y$-directions, performed during the same LHC fill on 15 May 2011. The beams had 14 colliding bunch pairs, $\sim0.8\times 10^11$ protons per bunch, $\beta^*=\SI{1.5}{\meter}$, and a crossing angle of $\alpha=\SI{240}{\micro\radian}$. The resulting transverse beam size is approximately $\sigma_{x}\approx\sigma_{y}\approx \SI{40}{\micro\meter}$, and the average number of interactions per cross with head-on collisions is $\mu\approx 2.3$. The scan was performed in 25 equal steps over a displacement range of $\delta=\pm 233 \micron$.

An example scan curve showing $\mu_{\mathrm{vis}}^{\mathrm{sp}}\equiv \mu_{\mathrm{vis}}/(n_1n_2)$ as a function of transverse beam separation for the BCMV\_OR algorithm is shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-vdm-curve}. The vdM scan curve is fitted with a Gaussian plus a constant, which is used as $R_{x,y}(\delta)$ to calculate $\Sigma_{x,y}$ in equation~\ref{eqn:reco-luminosity-CapSigma}. $\mu_{\mathrm{vis}}^{\mathrm{MAX}}$ is determined from the peak of the fitted function. The measured $\sigma_{\mathrm{vis}}$ values for both scans and all 14 colliding bunch pairs are shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-vdm-sigmavis-bcm-2011}. The luminosity-weighted mean $\sigma_{\mathrm{vis}}$ is taken as the central value, while the scatter of the 28 measurements, which is not consistent with statistical variation, is taken as a systematic uncertainty on the reproducibility of the measurement. 

The visible cross sections for several algorithms using during 2011 are shown in table~\ref{table:reco-luminosity-sigmavis-summary}, along with the efficiency assuming a total inelastic cross section of $\sigma_{\mathrm{inel}}= 71.34~\mbox{mb}$~\cite{TheATLASCollaboration:2014jo}.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties}\label{sec:reco-luminosity-uncertainties}
The systematic uncertainty on the 2011 and 2012 luminosity measurements are 1.8\% and 2.8\%\footnote{Preliminary uncertainty. The final uncertainty is expected to be below 2\%.}, respectively. No single source of uncertainty dominates the total; rather, the uncertainty is due to many sources, each contributing less than $1\%$. The sources of uncertainty on the 2011 luminosity measurement are shown in table~\ref{table:reco-luminosity-uncertainties}, divided into uncertainties on the visible cross section measurement during vdM scans and uncertainties on the measurement performed over the course of data taking. 

The combined uncertainty on the visible cross sections due to the vdM calibration procedure is $1.5\%$. The largest source of uncertainty is due to emittance growth and non-reproducibility, reflected in the scatter between BCIDs and between scans in figure~\ref{fig:reco-vdm-sigmavis-bcm-2011}. Other significant sources, each roughly $0.5\%$, include beam-beam effects, where the two colliding beams deflect each other away from the nominal transverse separation; transverse correlations which violate the assumption that the transverse particle densities factorize as $\rho(x,\,y)=\rho_x(x)\rho_y(y)$; pileup dependence; and the measurement of the number of protons per bunch, $n_{1,2}$. 

Uncertainties on the luminosity measurement over the 2011 data-taking period total $0.9\%$. These uncertainties are dominated by variations in the detector calibrations during 2011, quantified using relative comparisons between algorithms across the entire year, and pileup dependence, quantified using relative comparisons between algorithms at different pileup values. The relative comparisons are shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-luminosity-comparisons}.

\section{Vertex-Based Luminosity Measurement}

\subsection{Vertex Counting Method}
Primary vertices are points consistent with being the origin of a set of tracks reconstructed by the inner detector, nominally due to inelastic $pp$ interactions. The reconstruction of tracks and vertices is described in section~\ref{sec:event-reconstruciton-track-vertex}. Vertex counting is an appealing luminosity measurement technique for a number of reasons. The backgrounds are very low, and can be controlled by requiring a minimum number of tracks per vertex, chosen to be at least five tracks in this analysis. Further, the vertex reconstruction efficiency is expected to be stable throughout the data-taking period. However, the technique has two significant drawbacks. First, the data is collected through the standard ATLAS data acquisition system, limiting the rate during normal physics runs to $\mathcal{O}(\SI{100}{\hertz})$. Depending on the trigger used, a correction for the trigger deadtime may also be necessary. Second, the efficiency of the vertex reconstruction algorithm is significantly nonlinear with pileup, with the efficiency decreasing by $\sim30\%$ between pileup values of $\mu=1$ and $\mu=30$. 

The nonlinear efficiency with respect to pileup is due to three phenomena:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Vertex masking: a $pp$ interaction fails to be reconstructed as a vertex because some or all of its tracks are used by an earlier vertex in the iterative algorithm. 
	\item Fake vertices: a vertex passes the cut on the minimum number of tracks due to acquiring tracks from another nearby $pp$ interaction.
	\item Split vertices: a single interaction is reconstructed as two separate vertices.
\end{itemize}

Split vertices are a significant effect when considering all vertices with at least two tracks, but is negligible for vertices with at least five tracks. Fake vertices are a subdominant but significant effect. A correction is derived using truth matching in minimum bias Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation sample was generated using \pythia~8, with tune A2M~\cite{pythia}. For a given cut on the minimum number of tracks per vertex, $m$, a reconstructed vertex is labelled as fake if less than $m$ of its tracks are matched to charged particles originating from the same generated $pp$ interaction.

The average number of reconstructed vertices labelled as fake by Monte Carlo truth matching is shown as a function of pileup in figure~\ref{fig:fake-fractions}. The fake fractions show a significant dependence on $\mu$ and on the minimum number of tracks per vertex.

	\caption{Fraction of reconstructed vertices labelled as fake by Monte Carlo truth matching, as a function of pileup.}
	\label{fig:fake-fractions}
\end{figure}


Vertex masking is the dominant effect, causing the large drop in efficiency. Fake vertices are a smaller but significant effect, causing a small increase in the efficiency. Split vertices are a negligible effect once the vertices are required to have at least five tracks. 

A correction procedure is derived for vertex masking using the distribution of longitudinal distances, $\Delta z$, between pairs of vertices in the same event. In the absence of masking, if the interaction region has a Gaussian longitudinal profile with width $\sigma_z$, then the $\Delta z$ distribution would be a Gaussian with width $\sigma_z\times\sqrt{2}$. Masking manifests as an absence of reconstructed pairs near $\Delta z=0$, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-luminosity-deltaz}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\resizebox{4in}{!}{\includegraphics{figures/luminosity/dz_example}}
	\caption{$\Delta z$ distribution between pairs of vertices in the same event, with data from the May Van der Meer scan (ATLAS run 182013).}
	\label{fig:reco-luminosity-deltaz}
\end{figure}


A correction is derived in a data-driven way as follows. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item In a data sample with exactly two interactions per event, the number of masked pairs is equal to the number of masked vertices. Using data taken at low pileup values and selecting events with exactly two reconstructed vertices, we calculate the 2-vertex masking probability $p_{\textrm{mask}}(\Delta z)$, i.e. the probability that only one of two vertices separated by $\Delta z$ is reconstructed. This function is assumed to be a universal property of the vertexing algorithm, independent of $\mu$. 
	
	Specifically, the expected $\Delta z$ distribution in the absence of masking, $f_{\mathrm{exp}}(\Delta z)$, is derived by randomly sampling pairs of points from the observed $z$-distribution of reconstructed vertices. Using $f_{\mathrm{exp}}(\Delta z)$ as a template, the \emph{observed} $\Delta z$ distribution, $f_{\mathrm{obs}}(\Delta z)$, is fitted in the range $\SI{30}{\milli\meter}\leq|\Delta z| \leq \SI{300}{\milli\meter}$, where vertex masking is negligible. Finally, the masking probability is defined as:
	\begin{equation}
		p_{\textrm{mask}}(\Delta z) = \frac{f_{\mathrm{exp}}(\Delta z) - f_{\mathrm{obs}}(\Delta z)}{f_{\mathrm{exp}}(\Delta z)}
	\end{equation}
	
	The masking probability functions derived from minimum bias Monte Carlo and for low-$\mu$ data are shown in figures~\ref{fig:masking-correction-data} and \ref{fig:masking-correction-mc}.
		
	\item To derive a correction for a particular data sample at arbitrary $\mu$, an \emph{expected} $\Delta z$ distribution, $f_{\mathrm{exp}}(\Delta z)$, is again derived by randomly sample pairs of vertices from the observed primary vertex $z$-distribution. Then, the total probability $p_{\textrm{mask}}$ that given any two tight vertices, only one is reconstructed can be computed: 
	\begin{equation}
		p_{\textrm{mask}} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p_{\textrm{mask}}(\Delta z) f_{\mathrm{exp}}(\Delta z) d(\Delta z).
	\end{equation}
	
	\item The total masking probability $p_{\textrm{mask}}$ is used to generate a map between the number of reconstructible vertices per event, $N_{\textrm{vis}}$, and the average number of reconstructed vertices per event, $\mu_{\textrm{rec}}$, as follows. Label the generated vertices $v_i$, $1 \leq i \leq N_{gen}$, in the order in which the iterative vertexing algorithm reconstructs the vertices; similarly, let $p_i$, $1\leq i \leq N_{\textrm{vis}}$, be the probability that vertex $v_i$ is reconstructed. Proceeding vertex-by-vertex, the $p_i$ follow a recursion relation:

	\begin{align}
		p_1 &= 1\\
		p_2 &= p_1 \times (1 - p_{\textrm{mask}})\\
		&... \\
		p_k &= \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left( p_i  \times (1-p_{\textrm{mask}}) + (1-p_i) \times 1\right)\\
		&= \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} \left(1 - p_i p_{\textrm{mask}}\right)\\
		&= p_{n-1} \times \left(1-p_{n-1} p_{\textrm{mask}}\right)
	\end{align}
	The average number of reconstructed vertices is then:
	\begin{align}
		\langle N_{\textrm{rec}} \rangle &= \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\textrm{vis}}} p_i.
	\end{align}
	
	\item Finally, a map is computed between the average number of reconstructible vertices, $\mu_{\textrm{vis}}$, and the average number of reconstructed vertices, $ \mu_{\textrm{rec}}(\mu_{\textrm{vis}})$, by convoluting $\mu_{\textrm{rec}}(N_{\textrm{vis}})$ with a Poisson distribution:
	\begin{align}
		\langle \mu_{\textrm{rec}} \rangle (\mu_{\textrm{vis}}) = \sum_{N_{\textrm{vis}}=0}^{\infty} P(N_{\textrm{vis}}; \mu_{\textrm{vis}}) \mu_{\textrm{rec}} (N_{\textrm{vis}}).
	\end{align}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Vertex-Based Luminosity Measurements}
Due to the low event rate available during physics runs, vertex counting was used to measure luminosity only in three special runs during 2011, where inner detector data was recorded by a special high-rate data stream. The data stream reads out events at $\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\kilo\hertz})$, recording only the inner detector from a small number of bunch crossings, typically less than four. The three runs are the vdM calibration run in May 2011, the pileup scan in September 2011 shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-luminosity-comparisons-pileup}, and a high-$\beta^{*}$ run with a single bunch used to measure the total $pp$ cross section using the ALFA detector. 

\ 

\subsubsection{Van der Meer Scan}

An example scan curve from the May 2011 vdM scan is shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-luminosity-vertex-vdm}. The trigger used to collect the data requires hits in the minimum bias trigger scintillators (MBTS), and selects 3 of the 14 colliding bunch pairs. The peak interaction rate during the scan is $\mu\sim1.97$. The data are corrected for vertex masking and fakes, with the correction factor reaching up to 3\% at the peak of the scan curves. Following the protocol described in section~\ref{sec:reco-luminosity-calibration}, the visible cross section is determined to be $\SI{38.6\pm 0.14}{\milli\barn}$, where the uncertainty reflects the RMS spread between the three bunch crossings and the two scans.

\end{figure}

\ 

\subsubsection{Pileup Scan}

The September 2011 pileup scan is used to derive systematic uncertainties due to the nonlinear response of algorithms with respect to the number of interactions per bunch crossing. The scan was performed at the end of a physics run, displacing the beams in the transverse direction to obtain a sample of data at different pileup values with otherwise identical conditions. The data was triggered by a random trigger selecting events from two bunch crossings, BCIDs 200 and 999. The data are corrected for vertex masking and fakes, with the correction reaching up to 10\% as shown in figure~\ref{reco-luminosity-vertexing-muscan-corrections} with respect to BCM\_VOR. A comparison of the luminosity measurements between vertex counting and BCM\_VOR, shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-luminosity-vertexing-muscan}, exhibits a slope of about 0.1\% per unit of $\mu$.

\end{figure}

\ 

\subsubsection{ALFA Run}

Finally, vertex counting provides a reliable luminosity measurement for the 2011 ALFA run, a special run used for a measurement of the total $pp$ cross section. The beams contain a single colliding bunch pair with $\beta^{*}=\SI{90}{\meter}$ and $\mu\sim0.03$, in order to measure the scattering angle of elastic $pp$ collisions. A special luminosity analysis is performed to address the very low instantaneous luminosity of $\mathcal{L}\sim\SI[per-mode=symbol]{5e27}{\centi\meter\tothe{-2}\second\tothe{-1}}$, about six orders of magnitude lower than a typical physics fill. The calorimeter methods are unusable due to a lack of sensitivity. For BCM and LUCID, the backgrounds at low instantaneous luminosity have a different composition: afterglow is negligible with a single colliding bunch, but beam-gas interactions can be significant, resulting in an extra 0.2\% systematic uncertainty. The low-pileup conditions are ideal for vertex counting, eliminating the need to perform pileup corrections. The cut on the minimum number of tracks per vertex suppresses the beam-gas backgrounds. The data were recorded by a random trigger at approximately 1~kHz. 

A comparison of luminosity measurements from BCM, LUCID, and vertex counting is shown in figure~\ref{fig:reco-luminosity-alfa}. To be consistent with the primary $pp$ luminosity measurement, the central value is taken from BCM\_VOR; vertex counting shows agreement with this value to within $0.5\%$.
