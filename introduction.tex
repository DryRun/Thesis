\chapter{Introduction}
% PLANNING
% - Summarize the state of the field.
% - Motivate the research presented: why do we think there's more? In brief.
% - Explain the analyses to be presented.

% Particle physics has seen the experimental verification of the Standard Model. Verified that we exist in a world of broken symmetry, where the Higgs field condensate is responsible for the mass of the known fundamental particles. All the parameters are known, although not all of the predictions (interactions) have yet been observed. 

% A small but compelling set of inconsistencies and philosophical shortcomings have generated a number of candidates for theories that extend the Standard model. The LHC has the power to explore a subset, or a part of the parameter space, of these many models. Energy and luminosity. 

% This dissertation presents a search using rare multilepton processes with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
